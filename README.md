# Space-Shuttle-reentry
In this report, the temperature inside of the tile used in a space shuttle was modelled with respect to time and thickness through the tile in 1 dimension. 
Finite different methods were analysed to find the method with the best accuracy and stability to approximate fouriers heat equation through the tile. 
The Crank-Nicolson method was remained stable for the longest time and spatial steps so this was the final method used for the model. 
Assumptions were made to simplify the model such as assuming the model was in only one dimension instead of three or assuming their was no heat dissipated into the shuttle from the internal value. 
The minimum thickness required to maintain the maximum internal temperature below 175o C with an error of 5o C was 0.0576m.
